# KaspaConcert — Pitch (3 slides)


## SLIDE 1 — The Problem

**Title:** Live stream monetization is broken.

**Subtitle (optional):** Creators and fans deserve better.

**Bullets (keep to 3–4 on slide):**
- **Delayed payouts** — Creators wait days or weeks; cash flow suffers.
- **Opaque & costly** — Platform fees and unclear revenue share eat into earnings.
- **No real-time on-chain option** — No widely adopted way to tip with crypto *during* a live stream, with instant feedback.

**Closing line (optional, bottom of slide):**  
*There is no “Like” button that sends real value, instantly, to the creator — until now.*

## SLIDE 2 — The Solution

**Title:** KaspaConcert — Real-time tipping on Kaspa.

**Subtitle:** Stream. Tip. Confirm in seconds.

**Bullets (keep to 3–4 on slide):**
- **Instant KAS tips** — Every tip is a real on-chain transaction; confirmation in seconds, thanks to Kaspa’s BlockDAG and sub-second blocks.
- **Non-custodial** — Funds go directly from viewer wallet to creator wallet (KasWare); we never hold keys or funds.
- **Live experience** — Embedded stream + real-time tip feed; tipping feels as immediate as a like, but with real value.
- **Only possible on Kaspa** — Real-time consumer payments need speed; Kaspa delivers it.

**Closing line (optional):**  
*Tipping that feels native to the stream — not bolted on.*

## SLIDE 3 — Why It Matters & What’s Next

**Title:** The first live-stream tipping platform on Kaspa.

**Subtitle:** For creators. For fans. For the ecosystem.

**Bullets (keep to 3–4 on slide):**
- **For creators** — Instant access to earnings; 100% of tips; transparent, verifiable on-chain.
- **For fans** — One-click support, instant confirmation, no platform friction.
- **For Kaspa** — A flagship use case that shows BlockDAG speed in a real product; open-source reference for real-time payments.
- **Built for Kaspathon** — Full flow working: create session → share link → tip with KasWare → see confirmation in under 10 minutes.

**Closing line / CTA:**  
*KaspaConcert proves real-time blockchain applications are here. Try the demo — and build the future of the creator economy with us.*
